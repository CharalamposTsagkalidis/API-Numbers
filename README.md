#  Number Classifier API (Spring Boot)

This is a Spring Boot application that exposes three endpoints to classify numbers into categories:

1. `/numbers` — Blocking classification of natural, whole, and real numbers
2. `/fnumbers` — Reactive (non-blocking) classification
3. `/prime-or-composite` — Determines if a number is **prime**, **composite**, or **neither**
